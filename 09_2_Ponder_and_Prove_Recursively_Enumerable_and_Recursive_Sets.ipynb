If the star operator exists, then the language must be infinite. However, two issues can occur with this. One, it would be difficult to determine loops that are not dependant on a star. So for example, if one state loops back to another. Second, if the star operator occurs on a black-hole state, we could get a false positive.\r\n","\r\n","To fix this, we will reduce our problem of finding if the language of a DFA is infinite to the equivalent problem of determining if a regular expression contains the star operator. This is done by converting the DFA to an NFA and then converting the NFA to a regular expression. This should remove the issue of black-hole states and make finding loops such as (abc)* much easier.\r\n","\r\n","<br>\r\n","\r\n","<br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5rVqkMA0kWFT"},"source":["2.
